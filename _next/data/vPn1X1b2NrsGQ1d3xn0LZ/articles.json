the most prosperous nations globally and is well positioned to prosper in the future the u s business environment actively supports startups promotes competition and expansion and innovation and

capital from domestic and international sources and there are strong property rights and protections in place for investors in addition to its many strengths however the country faces some significant challenges that are holding it back from performing even more strongly on the global stage in particular the united states ranks 66th on safety and security on par with morocco and 59th on health weaker than croatia these weaknesses which are experienced across many parts of the country are acting as a brake on further progress prosperity is distributed unevenly across the country the

california 25th and in many of the other states there is much greater variation in prosperity among the counties on the whole urban counties are more prosperous than rural counties although this is not universally the case for example yuma county in colorado has a population of around 10 000 but it ranks within the top 100 counties across the 12 states due to low crime and a strong business

much greater variation with four counties appearing in the 1st quintile and seven counties appearing in the 5th quintile and the remaining 48 counties appearing in the 2nd 3rd and 4th quintiles for example marin county one of the nine counties in the bay area of california is the 2nd most prosperous county in the state and in the 1st quintile in the county level index whereas mendocino county one county but one up the coast from marin county ranks 44th in the states county rankings and lies within the 4th quintile overall local nature of prosperity fig 1 constrained across some of the other selected states counties exhibit marked variations in their levels of prosperity florida 31st texas 33rd montana 34th and georgia 37th all have counties with a wide range of performance lying within each of the five quintiles and even in kentucky 43rd there are six counties in the 2nd quintile and nearly a third in the middle quintile interestingly most of the weaker counties in kentucky are in the appalachian region in the southeastern corner in addition to assessing the performance of counties within and across states the index also enables exploration of the performance of different types of counties urban and rural for example using the u s census bureaus classification on the whole urban counties perform more strongly than rural counties although the exact nature of how prosperity is comprised varies across the two area types for example urban counties generally exhibit a stronger economic performance especially infrastructure and social wellbeing such as education and health whereas rural counties have lower crime rates and stronger social networks the more prosperous propensity of urban counties is not universally true urban nassau county new york with a population density of over 4 500 people per square mile is roughly as prosperous as rural mineral county colorado which has fewer than one person per square mile demographic variation location alone does not capture all the differences in prosperity the most powerful and effective solutions will be realized when not only the disparities in prosperity at the local level are understood but also those between different groups in society consider education for example nationally among those without college education a black american was nearly twice as likely as a white american to be unemployed 15 4% vs 8 4% even with a degree black americans are over 50% more likely to be unemployed than white americans in addition over 17% of people in the most ethnically diverse counties avoided medical care due to the cost compared to 14% in the least ethnically diverse counties policies that seek to improve outcomes for the most disadvantaged americans can benefit from being sensitive to these differences and their underlying causes how these national patterns are experienced at a local level is therefore important for example the infant mortality rate for african american mothers in los angeles county is three times the rate of white mothers whereas in less urban solano county it is closer to twice the rate our county level index enables an initial assessment of how prosperity and its characteristics vary depending on the ethnic diversity of urban and rural counties using population estimates from the center for disease control and prevention by ethnic group in each of the 1 196 counties across the 12 selected states across the 12 states many rural counties in georgia eastern texas and northern florida have the highest share of people from a black

prosperity is better described as a tale of the big city and the small town across the nation urban counties are generally more prosperous than their rural counterparts equivalent to the difference between maine 18th and wyoming 25th in the state index the key difference between urban and rural counties is in the composition of that prosperity this is exhibited in terms of both better economic performance and social wellbeing in urban counties however rural counties do compensate somewhat by having lower crime rates and stronger social networks on average structural drivers of prosperity 1 constrained the overall structure and higher population density of a city confer many economic advantages most affected by urbanization is physical infrastructure the quality of transport as well as the coverage and efficiency of communications infrastructure is far better in urban counties the urban environment also provides the basis for better healthcare people generally live in closer proximity to medical facilities such as hospitals and clinics the proportion of people who report having been to the dentist and the doctor for routine check ups in the last year is higher in cities a greater proportion of people in rural counties have high rates of behavioral risk factors such as obesity and smoking there are of course health drawbacks associated with the high density environment of a city as we have seen with devastating effect recently as of early may the greater new york city area alone accounted for nearly a quarter of all covid 19 deaths in the united states rural counties however are in no way immune to pandemics and though the crowded nature of city life clearly accelerates infection the fact that cities bring together people from different walks of life also means that they foster the transmission of ideas in cities tertiary education and the skills of the adult population are substantially better than in rural areas by far the most differentiating factor is the proportion of adults who hold at least a bachelors degree in urban counties 36% of people on average have at least this level of qualification whereas in rural counties the figure is only 18% this is often because high skilled economic migrants whether they are from other countries other states or even from within the same state tend to move to cities where there are better universities and a greater range of employment opportunities at other stages of the education system pre k through high school there can be some benefits to living in cities such as a shorter distance to travel to school though the difference in the quality of education at this level is minor in comparison the high density nature of life in cities is a facilitator of many things but it changes the way that bonds of trust are formed between groups and can lead to more transactional rather than personal relationships institutional trust is higher in urban counties with residents relying more heavily on the police other institutions such as the media and government are more salient in an urban environment consequently these institutions earn a greater degree of trust from the people they serve further to this social tolerance is typically higher in cities evidenced by a lower incidence of hate groups and use of ethnic slurs that said the way people interact with those in more intermediate circles such as their neighborhoods and community organizations differs depending on the level of urbanization levels of civic and social participation and the amount of time that people spend engaging in community activities are both lower in cities nonetheless close personal relationships such as those that people form with their most proximate social circles family and friends appear to be independent of the population density and are as strong in cities as they are in rural counties other urbanization patterns while urbanization clearly plays a part in the story of prosperity in the united states it is far from the only factor and other drivers correlated with urbanization may confound this factor not only do cities have a distinct physical structure but their residents and the lives they lead also differ from those in rural america for example cities tend to have a greater share of working age residents more knowledge workers and a higher degree of ethnic diversity while two thirds of urban counties have a disproportionately large working age population share half of rural counties have a disproportionately small share these rural counties that have lower working age population shares generally have a very high number of those aged over 65 i e those that have retired and already left the workforce rather than a high proportion of children the proportion of knowledge workers those working in such sectors as finance and insurance or professional scientific and technical services varies dramatically with rurality however knowledge workers make up only 10%

tale of two cities american prosperity is better described as a tale of the big city and the small town across the nation urban counties are generally more prosperous than their rural counterparts equivalent to the difference between maine 18th and wyoming 25th in the state index the key difference between urban and rural counties is in the composition of that prosperity this is exhibited in terms of both better economic performance and social wellbeing in urban counties however rural counties do compensate somewhat by having lower crime rates and stronger social networks on average structural drivers of prosperity 1 constrained the overall structure and higher population density of a city confer many economic advantages most affected by urbanization is physical infrastructure the quality of transport as well as the coverage and efficiency of communications infrastructure is far better in urban counties the urban environment also provides the basis for better healthcare people generally live in closer proximity to medical facilities such as hospitals and clinics the proportion of people who report having been to the dentist and the doctor for routine check ups in the last year is higher in cities a greater proportion of people in rural counties have high rates of behavioral risk factors such as obesity and smoking there are of course health drawbacks associated with the high density environment of a city as we have seen with devastating effect recently as of early may the greater new york city area alone accounted for nearly a quarter of all covid 19 deaths in the united states rural counties however are in no way immune to pandemics and though the crowded nature of city life clearly accelerates infection the fact that cities bring together people from different walks of life also means that they foster the transmission of ideas in cities tertiary education and the skills of the adult population are substantially better than in rural areas by far the most differentiating factor is the proportion of adults who hold at least a bachelors degree in urban counties 36% of people on average have at least this level of qualification whereas in rural counties the figure is only 18% this is often because high skilled economic migrants whether they are from other countries other states or even from within the same state tend to move to cities where there are better universities and a greater range of employment opportunities at other stages of the education system pre k through high school there can be some benefits to living in cities such as a shorter distance to travel to school though the difference in the quality of education at this level is minor in comparison the high density nature of life in cities is a facilitator of many things but it changes the way that bonds of trust are formed between groups and can lead to more transactional rather than personal relationships institutional trust is higher in urban counties with residents relying more heavily on the police other institutions such as the media and government are more salient in an urban environment consequently these institutions earn a greater degree of trust from the people they serve further to this social tolerance is typically higher in cities evidenced by a lower incidence of hate groups and use of ethnic slurs that said the way people interact with those in more intermediate circles such as their neighborhoods and community organizations differs depending on the level of urbanization levels of civic and social participation and the amount of time that people spend engaging in community activities are both lower in cities nonetheless close personal relationships such as those that people form with their most proximate social circles family and friends appear to be independent of the population density and are as strong in cities as they are in rural counties other urbanization patterns while urbanization clearly plays a part in the story of prosperity in the united states it is far from the only factor and other drivers correlated with urbanization may confound this factor not only do cities have a distinct physical structure but their residents and the lives they lead also differ from those in rural america for example cities tend to have a greater share of working age residents more knowledge workers and a higher degree of ethnic diversity while two thirds of urban counties have a disproportionately large working age population share half of rural counties have a disproportionately small share these rural counties that have lower working age population shares generally have a very high number of those aged over 65 i e those that have retired and already left the workforce rather than a high proportion of children the proportion of knowledge workers those working in such sectors as finance and insurance or professional scientific and technical services varies dramatically with rurality however knowledge workers make up only 10% of employment in rural counties on average while 28% of employment in urban counties falls in this category in contrast

(Please note, element and indicator rankings are only displayed for the state level Index but are available for counties in the county profile datasheets available to download.)<br /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We endeavor to create an Index that is methodologically sound, so have consulted a working group of academics and experts with knowledge spanning all of the metrics in the Index to determine the best way to measure prosperity across the U.S.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our methodology is based on the concept of three domains, capturing institutional, economic, and social wellbeing, that are equally essential to prosperity. These domains are measured through 11 pillars, built upon 48 actionable policy areas (elements), and underpinned by over 200 indicators. For details of how each pillar, element, and indicator is currently weighted in the Index, you can download a copy of our full methodology report in <a href=\"https://www.americandreamprosperity.com/downloads/reports\">the Downloads section</a> of the site, along with the full 2021 dataset.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, we know that different people may have different views on how important each metric is to a state or county's prosperity. So, we have created a Weightings tool that allows you to assign different weights - that is, different levels of importance - to the pillars, elements, and indicators.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you click on the 'Adjust Weightings' button, you can choose to assign each metric in the current ranking table a value from x0 to x2 of the default ADPI weighting. The tool will then re-calculate the rankings based on your preferences. [Please note that the weighting function is intended to provide only an indicative understanding of how changing the weights can affect the rankings.
