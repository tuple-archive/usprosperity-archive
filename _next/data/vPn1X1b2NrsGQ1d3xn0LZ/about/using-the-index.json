For details of how each pillar, element, and indicator is currently weighted in the Index, you can download a copy of our full methodology report in <a href=\"https://www.americandreamprosperity.com/downloads/reports\">the Downloads section</a> of the site, along with the full 2021 dataset.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, we know that different people may have different views on how important each metric is to a state or county's prosperity. So, we have created a Weightings tool that allows you to assign different weights - that is, different levels of importance - to the pillars, elements, and indicators.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you click on the 'Adjust Weightings' button, you can choose to assign each metric in the current ranking table a value from x0 to x2 of the default ADPI weighting.

Further to this, the Index also provides data over a 10-year period, making it possible to see whether prosperity has been improving or deteriorating over time, and what specifically is driving that change.

This will help inform the required policy action to strengthen performance. For example, it may be discovered that a state or a county’s poor prosperity rankings are driven by a weak performance in education. Upon further investigation, the Index reveals that, although current education policy in the state is weaker in K-12 education, it has been focused on improving tertiary education when contrasted with comparator states. In particular, further investigation of the Index reveals that low completion rates may be driving the weak performance in K-12 education. This information can help to target specific areas that need improvement and provide a starting point for what can be done to improve education, and thereby increase prosperity.</p>\n<p>By using the historical data provided by the Index for the example above, it may become apparent that K-12 completion rates have declined rapidly over the past three years. Discussion with local education officials on the decline may reveal that this coincides with the conclusion of a learning difficulties support program, thus pointing to the particular area where action is needed.</p>"},{"id":"1061","title":null,"typeHandle":"divider"},{"id":"1024","title":null,"typeHandle":"text","text":"<h3 class=\"largeHeading\">Resources Available</h3>\n<p>There are several tools available to aid analysis and interpretation of, and elicit insight from, The American Dream Prosperity Index.

These can be developed and refined using the more in-depth accompanying resources outlined above.</p>\n<h5 class=\"smallHeading\"><strong>Policymakers</strong></h5>\n<p>The Index and its accompanying resources allow policymakers to benchmark the performance of their state or county against peers across 11 pillars and 48 elements of prosperity to create a much more granular perspective of performance and to identify the potential binding constraints to development.</p>\n<p>Each of the 48 elements of prosperity have been designed to be recognizable, discrete areas of domestic policy, and are measured using a combination of indicators from a variety of public data sources. The indicators should be interpreted as a set of proxies for the underlying policy concept, and we would encourage policymakers to interpret their score and rank for an element as the trigger for more fundamental analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of its performance. Benchmarking against the basket of indicators within the indexes must be complemented by in-depth context-sensitive analysis, which itself can lead to more balanced agendas across a range of policy areas.</p>\n<p>In addition to helping focus analysis, these materials, together with the database of performance, also allow policymakers to develop diagnostic tools and to identify potential options to consider, based on the performance of other states and counties, and the case studies provided.</p>\n<h5 class=\"smallHeading\"><strong>Philanthropists</strong></h5>\n<p>There are many opportunities to invest in building stronger social, political, and economic outcomes across the United States. Reversing the decline seen in social capital across the United States will help further increase the prosperity of U.S. citizens. There is a unique role for philanthropists to identify and champion what it takes to build social capital across the counties and states of the U.S.</p>\n<h5 class=\"smallHeading\"><strong>Investors and business leaders</strong></h5>\n<p>The business community is well positioned to identify barriers to starting, operating, and growing business, and to demonstrate to government the economic potential from reforms such as lifting onerous regulation and reducing other barriers to help improve the investment environment.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, business leaders and investors can contribute to infrastructure policy development by demonstrating the economic impact of investment in communications, transport, and energy projects, where they can be the binding constraint on further increasing prosperity.</p>\n<h5 class=\"smallHeading\"><strong>Academics and Researchers</strong></h5>\n<p>For academics and researchers, our database of curated indicators is a unique resource enabling comparison of trends and patterns across the past 14 years for much of the data. By providing a holistic dataset across many disciplines, it provides an opportunity to compare in a straightforward way the impact of disparate factors, such as how living conditions are related to education levels, or how levels of social tolerance are related to levels of institutional trust.</p>\n<h5 class=\"smallHeading\"><strong>Journalists and civil society</strong></h5>\n<p>The American Dream Prosperity Index, at a state and county level, is based on publicly available and verifiable data, which means it can be a powerful resource for those who want to hold up a mirror to those in power and society at large. Holding leaders to account is a crucial role for both journalists and civil society. The institutional, economic and social performance of a state and county is critical to its prosperity, and that of the United States as a whole, and having non-government actors calling out weaknesses, as well as celebrating successes, can help spur on state and county leaders. To do so well requires easy access to reliable data that can be represented in a digestible way.</p>"},{"id":"1063","title":null,"typeHandle":"divider"},{"id":"1026","title":null,"typeHandle":"text","text":"<h3 class=\"largeHeading\">The Pathway to Transformation</h3>\n<p>Transformation is a process, not an event. Intermediate benchmarks are most helpful and effective, and the most obvious challenges facing a state, or a county, should be considered in the first instance. Understanding the specifics of each state and county’s circumstances will be critical to determining the sequencing and prioritization. The Indexes provide a set of hypotheses to test. The areas of highest priority will likely be the elements that are performing relatively poorly, but are not necessarily the weakest performing elements, as creating the conditions to warrant improving the weakest performing elements may require improving some of the elements that are less weak first.</p>\n<p>It is important to identify the most binding constraint to progress and use it to inform the sequencing and prioritization. To give a rather simplified example, a state may find itself with a weak environment for investment and also low levels of dynamism. In such a situation, simply seeking to increase investment is unlikely to have much of an impact, as investors will be more attracted to investing in an area where there is already a high number of start-ups and new entrepreneurs. In such a circumstance, creating an environment that attracts new businesses and start-ups would likely be a more impactful first step.</p>\n<p>As no single state has yet succeeded in fully securing both economic and social wellbeing for its residents, clear opportunities exist for states and counties to learn from each other. The Indexes identify these opportunities for improvement, and also where other states and counties have been successful in addressing the same challenges. This can guide supplementary research to inform the ways in which successful strategies from one region might be adapted to address weaknesses in another region.</p>"}],"seomatic":{"metaTitleContainer":"{\"title\":{\"title\":\"Using the Index – US Prosperity\"}}","metaTagContainer":"{\"generator\":[],\"keywords\":[],\"description\":{\"content\":\"State and county leaders can use it to help shape priorities for a policy agenda for their area;
