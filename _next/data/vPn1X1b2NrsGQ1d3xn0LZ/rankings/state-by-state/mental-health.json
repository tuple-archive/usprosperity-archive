(Please note, element and indicator rankings are only displayed for the state level Index but are available for counties in the county profile datasheets available to download.)<br /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We endeavor to create an Index that is methodologically sound, so have consulted a working group of academics and experts with knowledge spanning all of the metrics in the Index to determine the best way to measure prosperity across the U.S.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our methodology is based on the concept of three domains, capturing institutional, economic, and social wellbeing, that are equally essential to prosperity. These domains are measured through 11 pillars, built upon 48 actionable policy areas (elements), and underpinned by over 200 indicators. For details of how each pillar, element, and indicator is currently weighted in the Index, you can download a copy of our full methodology report in <a href=\"https://www.americandreamprosperity.com/downloads/reports\">the Downloads section</a> of the site, along with the full 2021 dataset.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, we know that different people may have different views on how important each metric is to a state or county's prosperity. So, we have created a Weightings tool that allows you to assign different weights - that is, different levels of importance - to the pillars, elements, and indicators.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you click on the 'Adjust Weightings' button, you can choose to assign each metric in the current ranking table a value from x0 to x2 of the default ADPI weighting. The tool will then re-calculate the rankings based on your preferences. [Please note that the weighting function is intended to provide only an indicative understanding of how changing the weights can affect the rankings.
