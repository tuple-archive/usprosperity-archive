prosperity had been rising continuously for more than a decade prosperity weakened between 2020 and 2021 but a strong resurgence in new business applications signals hope for the recovery even prior to covid 19 there were some significant challenges acting as a brake on u s prosperity the united states is one of the most prosperous countries in the world the united states continues to be one of the most prosperous nations globally and is well positioned to prosper in the future the u s business environment actively supports startups promotes competition and expansion and innovation and ideation are encouraged which results in a very strong global ranking of 4th for enterprise conditions it ranks 10th in the world for its investment environment u s businesses have good access to capital from domestic and international sources and there are strong property rights and protections in place for investors in addition to its many strengths however the country faces some significant challenges that are holding it back from performing even more strongly on the global stage in particular the united states ranks 66th on safety and security on par with morocco and 59th on health weaker than croatia these weaknesses which are experienced across many parts of the country are acting as a brake on further progress prosperity is distributed unevenly across the country the northeastern states exhibit the highest levels of prosperity with massachusetts almost always the top performing state over the past decade outside the northeast minnesota 3rd and utah 5th also perform well the southeastern states are the least prosperous with mississippi the weakest performing state in 2021 and in five of the past 11 years and arkansas the weakest in other years the distribution of prosperity among counties in a state varies significantly across the 12 states in nebraska 14th and oklahoma 47th for example all counties share similar levels of prosperity whereas in california 25th and in many of the other states there is much greater variation in prosperity among the counties on the whole urban counties are more prosperous than rural counties although this is not universally the case for example yuma county in colorado has a population of around 10 000 but it ranks within the top 100 counties across the 12 states due to low crime and a strong business environment the socioeconomic differences that exist across the united states are reflected by race and ethnicity and by place for example prior to the pandemic one in two adults in a white family were degree educated compared to less than one in four for a black family furthermore among those without college education a black american was nearly twice as likely as a white american to be unemployed 15 4% vs 8 4% population demographics interact with county prosperity prosperity levels across urban and rural counties can vary considerably depending on the share of the resident population from black and african american backgrounds for example counties that have a black population share of less than 2 5% exhibit similar levels of prosperity irrespective of whether they are urban or rural but in rural counties prosperity is weakest in counties that have the highest black population share dark blue line in the chart in urban counties however prosperity levels are broadly the same irrespective of the share of the black population grey line executive summary fig 1 constrained while this pattern is broadly consistent across the different characteristics of prosperity there are a few notable exceptions for example safety and security is weakest in counties that have the highest black population share across both urban and rural areas although safety and security is weaker in urban counties than in rural counties across all four groups additionally infrastructure is strong in big cities which have high black share of population this fairly simple analysis suggests that the experiences of black and african americans across many aspects of society are variable when where they live is taken into account to comprehend fully how prosperity is built and distributed across different ethnic and racial groups further investigation is necessary and we will be exploring that in greater detail in future editions of the index reports u s prosperity had been rising continuously for more than a decade prior to the pandemic u s prosperity had been rising year on year for over 10 years due to long term improvements across many aspects of u s society including the economy education and crime and as a result of americans smoking and drinking less increased productivity the u s economy responded strongly following the global financial crisis enjoying the longest period of economic growth in its history the increase in prosperity was in part due to a steady increase in productivity and competitiveness

population share dark blue line in the chart in urban counties however prosperity levels are broadly the same irrespective of the share of the black population grey line executive summary fig 1 constrained while this pattern is broadly consistent across the different characteristics of prosperity there are a few notable exceptions for example safety and security is weakest in counties that have the highest black population share across both urban and rural areas although safety and security is weaker in urban counties than in rural counties across all four groups additionally infrastructure is strong in big cities which have high black share of population this fairly simple analysis suggests that the experiences of black and african americans across many aspects of society
